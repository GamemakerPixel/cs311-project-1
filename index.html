	  Right to Repair is a movement aimed at passing legislation that would require companies to make available to their consumers and independant repair providers
the tools, documentation, and parts neccesary to repair electronic devices they have purchased. Let's break each part of that down. Consumers of electronic
devices need to have access to the tools nessesary to work on their device. When you think of a tool, you may think of a screwdriver, wrench, or even a
soldering iron. But these tools are already avaliable for consumers to purchase. Often, proprietary tools, such as software, are not for sale to consumers, and
are only used by the manufacturer's offical repair service. Proprietary software like this may be nessesary to calibrate parts or diagnose specific issues,
among other things. In a world where technology is getting increasingly more complex, documentation, like schematics, are often nessesary to fix a device at
the component level. Just because you can see what's inside a device doesn't mean you know how its wired. Finally, consumers need the parts to fix their 
devices. Far too frequently, manufacturers sell little to no parts to their products. Apple in particular is known to make slight changes to common chips, like
flipping the position of a few pins, and then tell their contractors not to sell the chip to anyone else. This encourages consumers to consider buying an 
entirely new device before they consider trying to repair their device.

	Overall, the Right to Repair is supported in four main areas. Right to repair would drive down the cost of maintaining personal computing devices (phones, 
laptops, desktops, etc.) and allow consumers to use an older device for as long as they would like, without being dependant on the manufacturer for repair
services. It would also allow farmers to get their equipment fixed a lot faster than if they have to wait for the offical repair provider to send someone out
to them. This allows them to avoid missing the small time windows they have to work in if they want a significant crop yeild. Additionally, it would allow 
hospitals to operate cheaper and better handle large amounts of patients, making them less prone to being overloaded during a crisis. Also, it would give
wheelchair users the ability to get their wheelchair fixed in a timely manner, when it can frequently take four or more weeks for an offical repair to be
completed. Finally, encouraging people to repair their devices promotes both reduction and reuse of potential e-waste - two factors often considered to be far
more important than recycling.
