      <h1>Right to Repair for Farming Equipment</h1>
      <p>
	Right to repair for farmers is critical for two reasons: time and money. When a piece of large
farming equiment breaks down, its not as simple as just driving it over to the manufacturer for a
repair. Farms are frequently very far from urban areas, making the drive to an equipment manufacturer
such as John Deere too time consuming. Even when the manufacturer sends out a repair technitian to the
location of the equipment, the time between the diagnosis of the problem and the shipping of the replacement
part can mean a farmer is unable to do a time-critial task, such as harvesting a crop. Because of 
this, some farmers have actually continued to use older equipment with less restrictions on repair.

	Additionally, farming equipment manufacturers, while they might sell the peice of equipment itself,
they often do not give their customers the rights to use the software imbedded inside the equipment,
meaning farmers now lack the ability to diagnose and fix problems with their equipment. (See video below.)
