      <h1>How Right to Repair Helps Protect the Environment</h1>
      <p>
	Reduse, reuse, recycle. The three R's of sustainable waste management. While you almost certainly
hear about recycling the most, it comes last for a reason. Redusing and reusing waste are significantly
more effective at achieving sustainable waste management. Redusing waste reduces the amount of waste
that has to be reused, recycled, or disgarded. But all waste cannot be avoided, and the second best
thing to do with it is reuse it. Recycling is essentially a mix of reusing waste and disgarding it,
as not everything is recyclable, recycled materials are often more expensive than making new ones,
and they are often of a worse quality than the original material. (This is why you see labels on
recycled packing that say it is some percent recycled materials, not entirely recycled materials.)

	Right to repair achieves both waste reduction and waste reuse. By only replacing parts, or even individual
components that are broken, only that part ends up as waste. By replacing the entire part or device,
a bunch of perfectly working pieces are thrown away. Additionally, when people do decide to switch 
to a new device, they can sometimes sell their old device for parts. Repair shops can then reuse those
parts in a device they are fixing, preventing them from going to waste.

      As a side note on recycling, Apple has been known to have a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/94386/the-truth-about-apples-free-iphone-recycling-program-the-earth-deserves-better">
"total destruction" policy</a> on the devices they send to recycling providers. This means
that each device and all its parts must be destroyed - nothing can be reused, and the maximal
amount of waste (other than simply discarding devices) is generated.
