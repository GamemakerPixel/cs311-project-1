      <h1>Right to Repair for Medical Equipment and Wheelchairs</h1>
      <p>
	Right to repair would enable hospitals and other medical centers to get their equipment repaired
faster and cheaper. This could help make them more resistant to large surges in patients, such as
those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and would lower the overall cost of healthcare, for both 
consumers and insurance programs. (Some of which are publicly funded.) Below is an brief interview by
Louis Rossman (a right to repair activist) with representatives of Mobile Instrument, a company
that repairs surgical equipment.

	One particularly notable piece of medical equipment are wheelchairs. If a wheelchair is broken,
it has the potential to effectively immobilize its owner until it is repaired. But, as with most
industries involving tech, manufacturers don't typically provide options for users to repair their
wheelchair on their own or by using an independant repair provider. In addition, insurance companies
will often specify specific manufacturers who they will pay to repair a wheelchair. In a study 
conducted by the PIRG Education Fund, <a href="https://publicinterestnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/USPIRGEF_Stranded_June2022.pdf">
62% of respondants indicated that they, on average, had to wait four or more weeks for a
wheelchair repair (page 18).</a>
